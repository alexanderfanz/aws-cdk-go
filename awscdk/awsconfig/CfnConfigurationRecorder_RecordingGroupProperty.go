package awsconfig


// Specifies which resource types AWS Config records for configuration changes.
//
// In the recording group, you specify whether you want to record all supported resource types or to include or exclude specific types of resources.
//
// - ***Regional resources*** - By default, AWS Config records configuration changes for all current and future supported types of *Regional resources* that AWS Config discovers in the AWS Region where it is running. When AWS Config adds support for a new type of Regional resource, AWS Config starts recording resources of that type automatically.
//
// Regional resources are tied to a Region and can be used only in that Region. You create them in a specified AWS Region , and then they exist in that Region. To see or interact with those resources, you must direct your operations to that Region. For example, to create an Amazon EC2 instance with the AWS Management Console , you [choose the AWS Region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/select-region.html) that you want to create the instance in. If you use the AWS Command Line Interface ( AWS CLI ) to create the instance, then you include the `--region` parameter. The AWS SDKs each have their own equivalent mechanism to specify the Region that the operation uses.
//
// There are several reasons for using Regional resources. One reason is to ensure that the resources, and the service endpoints that you use to access them, are as close to the customer as possible. This improves performance by minimizing latency. Another reason is to provide an isolation boundary. This lets you create independent copies of resources in multiple Regions to distribute the load and improve scalability. At the same time, it isolates the resources from each other to improve availability.
//
// If you specify a different AWS Region in the console or in an AWS CLI command, then you can no longer see or interact with the resources you could see in the previous Region.
//
// When you look at the [Amazon Resource Name (ARN)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html) for a Regional resource, the Region that contains the resource is specified as the fourth field in the ARN. For example, an Amazon EC2 instance is a Regional resource. The following is an example of an ARN for a Amazon Virtual Private Cloud ( Amazon VPC ) that exists in the `us-east-1` Region:
//
// `arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:123456789012:instance/i-0a6f30921424d3eee` .
// - ***Global resources*** - Some AWS services resources are *global resources* , meaning that you can use the resource from **anywhere** . You don't specify an AWS Region in a global service's console. To access a global resource, you don't specify a `--region` parameter when using the service's AWS CLI and AWS SDK operations.
//
// Global resources support cases where it is critical that only one instance of a particular resource can exist at a time. In these scenarios, replication or synchronization between copies in different Regions is not adequate. Having to access a single global endpoint, with the possible increase in latency, is considered acceptable to ensure that any changes are instantaneously visible to consumers of the resource.
//
// For example, Amazon Aurora global clusters ( `AWS::RDS::GlobalCluster` ) are global resources, and therefore not tied to a Region. This means that you can create a global cluster without relying on a regional endpoint. The benefit is that, while the Amazon Relational Database Service ( Amazon RDS ) itself is organized by Regions, the specific Region where a global cluster originates doesn't impact the global cluster. It appears as a single, continuous global cluster across all Regions.
//
// The [Amazon Resource Name (ARN)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html) for a global resource doesn't include a Region. The fourth field is empty, such as in the following example of an ARN for a global cluster:
//
// `arn:aws:rds::123456789012:global-cluster:test-global-cluster` .
//
// > Configuration changes for global resources are recorded by AWS Config in two different ways: 1) *regionally recorded* in only in the home Region of the global resource or 2) *globally recorded* in all enabled Regions.
//
// - ***Regionally recorded*** - Global resources for the following services are only recorded in the home Region of the global resource type: Amazon Elastic Container Registry Public , AWS Global Accelerator , and Amazon RouteÂ 53 . For these global resources, the same instance of the resource type can be used in multiple AWS Regions, but the configuration items are only recorded in the home Region for the commercial partition or AWS GovCloud (US-West) for the AWS GovCloud (US) partition.
//
// For a table of the Home Regions for Global Resource Types, see [Selecting Which Resources AWS Config Records](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/select-resources.html) in the *AWS Config developer guide* .
// - ***Globally recorded*** - Globally recorded resource types are recorded in all supported AWS Config Regions where the configuration recorder is enabled. Currently, there are two types of globally recorded resources: Aurora global clusters and IAM resources.
//
// *Aurora global clusters*
//
// `AWS::RDS::GlobalCluster` is a globally recorded resource type. It is recorded in all supported Amazon RDS Regions where the configuration recorder is enabled.
//
// *IAM resources*
//
// The following IAM resource types are also globally recorded: IAM users, groups, roles, and customer managed policies. However, these resource types are only recorded in all supported Amazon RDS Regions where the configuration recorder is enabled and that were supported by AWS Config ; *before* February 2022. This list does not include the following Regions: Asia Pacific (Hyderabad), Asia Pacific (Melbourne), Europe (Spain), Europe (Zurich), Israel (Tel Aviv), and Middle East (UAE).
//
// > When you select *Include globally recorded resource types* in the AWS Config console, or input `includeGlobalResourceTypes=true` using the API or CLI, this option only applies to globally recorded resources. This option does *not* apply to global resources recorded only in a home Region.
//
// For a list of supported resource types, see [Supported Resource Types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/resource-config-reference.html#supported-resources) in the *AWS Config developer guide* .
//
// > If you don't want AWS Config to record all resources, you can specify which types of resources AWS Config records with the `resourceTypes` parameter.
//
// Example:
//   // The code below shows an example of how to instantiate this type.
//   // The values are placeholders you should change.
//   import "github.com/aws/aws-cdk-go/awscdk"
//
//   recordingGroupProperty := &RecordingGroupProperty{
//   	AllSupported: jsii.Boolean(false),
//   	ExclusionByResourceTypes: &ExclusionByResourceTypesProperty{
//   		ResourceTypes: []*string{
//   			jsii.String("resourceTypes"),
